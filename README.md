Codebits Quest
==============

Codebits Quest is an ASCII game initially developed at [Codebits 2014](https://codebits.eu).

You're a regular participant trying to win the amazing 48-hour hackaton prize.

In order to win you must present your project. In order to present your project you must have skills. In order to have skills you must attend talks in the stages.

If this wasn't enought, you must survive as well... Make sure you keep your stamina up, regulate you're food and water intake and... Well, just lots of other things...

This game is under development and acts as an experience of trying to create a basic ASCII game, inspired by [A dark room](http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/) and [Candy box](http://candies.aniwey.net/).
